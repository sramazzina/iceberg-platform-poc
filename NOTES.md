# Notes

Deviations from the requirements (`docs/req/prompt-agente-lab-iceberg-polaris-nessie.md`)
and conflicts between the requirements and the project documentation.
Each entry: what the requirement says, what the lab does, and why.

## Deviations

### D1 — Repository root name
- Requirement (section 7): the root folder is `iceberg-catalog-lab/`.
- Lab: the root is the repository `iceberg-platform-poc`.
- Why: the repository already existed with this name. The layout below the root follows section 7.

### D2 — `aws/setup.sh` uses the existing VM role
- Requirement (section 6.4): `setup.sh` creates the instance profile.
- Lab: the VM and its instance profile already exist. `setup.sh` finds the VM role
  from `INSTANCE_ID` and adds the inline policy `iceberg-lab-vm` to it.
  `teardown.sh` removes only that inline policy.
- Why: the VM was created before the lab, with its own role.

### D3 — The VM role can list `polaris/`
- Requirement (section 6.1): the VM role has S3 access to `nessie/` and `rest/`.
- Lab: the VM role can also **list** (not read, not write) `polaris/` and the bucket root.
- Why: scenario 2 and the smoke tests use `aws s3 ls` to show the Polaris layout.
  Reads and writes under `polaris/` still need credentials vended by Polaris.

### D4 — Phase 1 test object prefix
- Requirement (phase 1): read and write a test file in `s3://${S3_BUCKET}/`.
- Lab: the test writes under `s3://${S3_BUCKET}/rest/_smoke/`.
- Why: the VM role has no write access to the bucket root (least privilege).

### D5 — Python packages are pinned in `spark/requirements.txt`
- Requirement (rule 4.2): pin every version in `.env`.
- Lab: image tags and JAR versions are in `.env`; Python packages are in `spark/requirements.txt`.
- Why: pip reads a requirements file natively; one build argument per package would add noise.

### D6 — Python 3.10 in the Spark image
- The official `apache/spark:4.1.3` images are based on Ubuntu 22.04, so Python is 3.10.
  Python 3.10 reaches end of life in October 2026. pandas and pyarrow are pinned to the
  last releases that support Python 3.10 (2.3.3 and 25.0.1). Accepted for a test lab.

### D7 — Iceberg client 1.11.0, not the latest 1.12.0
- Polaris 1.8.0 and Nessie 0.109.0 are built against Iceberg 1.11.0. The lab uses the same
  client version, so that compatibility is not a variable in the comparison.

## Open investigations

Filled in during phases 2-4.

- Polaris `relational-jdbc` bootstrap (admin tool job).
- Polaris credential vending against S3-compatible on-premise storage (`stsUnavailable`, `stsEndpoint`).
- Nessie credential vending (`client-iam`, `server-iam`).
- `apache/iceberg-rest-fixture`: no tag matches Iceberg 1.11; the lab uses 1.10.1.
